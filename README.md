This assignment uses Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). VBA scripting is used to analyze stock market data for three (3) years. Scripting was written to successfully loop through a yearâ€™s worth of stock data. The following was captured for each row:

<li>Ticker symbol</li>
<li>Volume of stock</li>
<li>Open price</li>
<li>Close price</li>
<br>

New columns were created that stored:<br>

<li>Ticker symbol</li>
<li>Total stock volume</li>
<li>Yearly change ($)</li>
<li>Percent change </li>

<br>
Conditional formatting was applied to the Yearly Change column, indicating if the annual change was positive or negative. The VBA scripting was deployed across all sheets in the Excel file.
